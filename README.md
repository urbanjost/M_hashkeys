## NAME

### M_hashkeys - a collection of hash key generator modules

## DESCRIPTION

   M_hashkeys(3f) is a Fortran repository that contains several modules 
   of hash generators.

## DOCUMENTATION   ![docs](docs/images/docs.gif)
### USER

All documents are contained in the docs/ directory including
archive files of man(1) pages that can be installed on ULS
(Unix-Like Systems).

#### Individual man-pages as HTML

   HTML versions of the man-pages describe all the routines:
   - An [index](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_hashkeys/man3.html) to M_hashkeys.f90 and M_sha3.f90 

#### All man-pages amalgamated as HTML

   Another view of these documents (that uses javascript to combine all
   the HTML descriptions of the man-pages) is in a form that can easily be printed as a single document.
   - [*BOOK_M_hashkeys*](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_hashkeys/BOOK_M_hashkeys.html) 
   - [*BOOK_M_sha3*](https://urbanjost.github.io/M_hashkeys/BOOK_M_sha3.html)

## DOWNLOAD AND BUILD

<!--
### gmake ![gmake](docs/images/gnu.gif)

   ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_hashkeys.git
       cd M_hashkeys/src
       # change Makefile if not using one of the listed compilers
       make clean; make gfortran    # for gfortran
       make clean; make ifort       # for ifort
       make clean; make nvfortran   # for nvfortran
   ```
   This will compile the M_hashkeys module and example programs.

### fpm ![fpm](docs/images/fpm_logo.gif)

   Download the github repository and build it with
   fpm ( as described at [Fortran Package Manager](https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm) )

   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/urbanjost/M_hashkeys.git
        cd M_hashkeys
        fpm test
   ```

   or just list it as a dependency in your fpm.toml project file.

```toml
        [dependencies]
        M_hashkeys        = { git = "https://github.com/urbanjost/M_hashkeys.git" }
